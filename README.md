# HackTenders

Lack of transparency in the tendering process and assigning contracts to agencies for road development etc. has led to unwise use of money and the spirit of speculation. This is currently due to the age old tradition of using papers and post while creating and filing tenders in government offices.
HackTenders is an innovative web app which uses one of the most rapidly growing domains of technology i.e. blockchain to solve the problem of tenders being so untransparent, particularly in a country like India. It combines the power of 2 decentralized platforms namely BigchainDB and Inter Planetary File System to make the tendering process super secure and tamper proof. We have seen that many times the tenders or other important papers are tampered with for personal gains. However, as our solution puts each and every tenders and all the bids made for them on a blockchain, it becomes immutable, even to the best attacks.

Also, as we are using open blockchains, the data is available to the entire public and can be easily verified by NGOs too.

## Use Cases

There are three main actors interacting with the system.

#### Government Official
- Creates new tenders 
- Give the contract for a particular tender to the contractor
- Verify the task completed by the contractor

#### Contractor
- View all Tenders
- Place bids on the active Tenders (Bids are encrypted and can't be viewed before the completion date to ensure fair practice)
- Gets contract assigned from Government officials
- Withdraw Tokens once task completion verified by Officials
- Gets paid in cryptocurrency immediately

#### Common People
- View all tenders
- View status of all ongoing contracts
- View the insights of past contracts
